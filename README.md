## DATA STRUCTURES, ALGORITHMS, 

Learning and advancing knowledge of:

- data structures;
- nodes;
- linked lists;
- hash maps;
- algorithmic concepts (recursion, asymptotic notation);
- nonlinear data strustures (trees, binary search and search trees, heaps);
- sorting algorithms (bubble sort, merge sort, quicksort);
- graph data structures (graphs, graph traversals, Dijkstra's algorithm).
